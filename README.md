1. Create a new nextjs project.

2. Using dummy API ( https://dummyjson.com/docs/products ), fetch products and render them on the home page.

Each product should be a card with a title, description, image and a link to its own page.

3. Create dynamic pages for each product.

The page should fetch data only for that product using the same API

It should render the same card as on the home page.

You can style this in any way using your own preferred method.

Send a link to GitHub with a code.

Extra: send a link with the deployed version.
